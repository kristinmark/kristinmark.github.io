		<div>PROJECT OVERVIEW</div>
		<div>Opportunity: 
Many musicians struggle to profit off their work and many music fans are seeking ways to discover and support musicians. With a redesign of the appLOUD native iOS app and desktop website, we saw an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between artists and music fans by further engaging the appLOUD community.

Goal:Reiterate the appLOUD app, with which we aimed to enable musicians to express their story, brand and performance schedule, while improving the way music fans find, share and tip musicians and their performances.

Challenges:The 3-week timeframe limited the amount of time we had to define our focus.
This affect was seen with - Contextual Inquiry, User interviews with musicians, Stakeholder interviews, Determining MVP.

		<div>ABOUT THE CLIENT:
appLOUD is a music app that aims to allow artist to monetize off of fan-generated live perfomrance videos, while empowering music fans to support performances they’ve enjoyed. Launched at the end of 2014 with the beta iOS native app, appLOUD’s mission is to provide a platform to promote the exchange of gratitude in the music community.

OPPORTUNITY: 
My team was approached to create version 2.0 of the iOS app & to revamp the appLOUD website. The different platforms struggled with inconsistent design & lack of intuitive flows. The iOS mobile & responsive website’s social features needed to match. Also, the site needed help with Information Architecture & optimizing search so it was easier to find artist pages.

SOLUTION:We iterated on the appLOUD app to make it more user friendly & enjoyable. The user processes we iterated on were: 
      1) ARTIST PROFILE; where musicians share their story, brand, & performance schedule, 
      2)  FAN INTERACTION; ability for fans to listen, share videos, & tip musicians.

CHALLENGES:* Iconography; confused users, but client team was admant on using
* Contextual inquiry; finding enough performances within the 3 week timeframe
* Time constraints; conducting entire UX process in 3 weeks

DELIVERABLES:Project Plan

Define who the users are and what they need.

Determine what the client the problem is and what are their goals from the project. What has the company tried already? Conduct heuristic analysis and usability testing on exisiting product.

Analyze the competitive and comparative markets to learn as much as possible from what has been done already. Specifically noting what works and what did not work well.</div>

		<div>Synthesize Research
Define who the users are and what they need. Affinity map key findings from market analysis & user research to find patterns in behaviors, context, pains, & pleasures.
Create Personas
Pin point user archetypes & give them a face to help focus the team on who’s problem we’re trying to solve..
Tell a Story
Map out the users’ journeys. What causes them to seek out the product or service? How will they interact with the product or service? How will they feel? When will they want to seek out our help? Also, determine user stories & scenarios as tools to lead design thinking during the next design thinking ideation stage.
Refine & Prioritize
Redefine the project goals and prioritize features. Utilize the Kano Method axis & MoSCoW Method to help team determine what must be in the minimum viable product, then what should, could, & won’t for now be in the team’s UX design.

		<div>My process is heavily influenced by IDEO’s design thinking. I’ve come up with my own fun acronym to help me articulate my creative thinking flow. (And it conveniantly spells out a favorite term in the industry: IDEATE).


</div>
		<div>Decipher & Empathize
</div>
		<div>User Flow
Draft out a user flow to decide what are the key interactions that need to be designed or iterated on.
Design Studio
Conduct a cross-functional design studio for a well-rounded brainstorm sketch session on the key screens or stages within a user experience. Diverge, converge, diverge, converge.
Wireframe
Using resulting final designs from design studio, create paper wireframes to test first. Once base design is validated through usability tests, continue on by creating low, medium, & high fidelity digital wireframes.
Prototype & Usability Test
Combine wireframes into an iteractive user flow and test with actual users to validate whether or not the design makes sense.
Iterate
Based on usability test results, make changes on the design to better suit user needs & delight.

		<div>My process is heavily influenced by IDEO’s design thinking. I’ve come up with my own fun acronym to help me articulate my creative thinking flow:
<< I.D.E.A.T.E. >> investigate > decipher & empathize > actualize & test & evolve









This is the foundation of my process. However, projects are rarely alike, so I tweak the stages along the way to suit the needs of each project objective and pivot where needed based on new user discoveries. Find out more information below.
</div>
		<div>ACTUALIZE & TEST & EVOLVE
Ideate, build, validate, iterate (rinse & repeat). This is where I have the most fun because the project focus is more clear & we can proceed to get our hands dirty in the rapid design iterative process. Several validated design cycles are involved, with heavy sketching, prototyping, usability testing, & design iterations. The number of cycles before delivery is determined by the project contraints and timeline.

+ Sitemaps & appmaps
+ Design studio

+ Wireframes (paper, lo-fidelity, med-fidelity, hi-fidelity)
