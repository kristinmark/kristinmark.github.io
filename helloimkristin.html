		<div>This is the foundation of my process. However, projects are rarely alike, so I tweak the stages along the way to suit the needs of each project objective, and pivot where needed based on new project discoveries. Find out more below.

		<div>I follow a research-based design thinking UX process, with a divergent, convergent, divergent, convergent flow. The below chart depicts the baseline of my process. 

</div>
		<div>Investigate






</div>
		<div>User research
Define who the users are and what they need.
Brand Analysis
Determine what the client the problem is and what are their goals from the project. What has the company tried already? Conduct heuristic analysis and usability testing on exisiting product.
Market Analysis
Analyze the competitive and comparative markets to learn as much as possible from what has been done already. Specifically noting what works and what did not work well.</div>
		<div>ACTUALIZE & TEST & EVOLVE

</div>
		<div>Synthesize Research
Define who the users are and what they need. Affinity map key findings from market analysis & user research to find patterns in behaviors, context, pains, & pleasures.
Create Personas
Pin point user archetypes & give them a face to help focus the team on who’s problem we’re trying to solve..
Tell a Story
Map out the users’ journeys. What causes them to seek out the product or service? How will they interact with the product or service? How will they feel? When will they want to seek out our help? Also, determine user stories & scenarios as tools to lead design thinking during the next design thinking ideation stage.
Refine & Prioritize
Redefine the project goals and prioritize features. Utilize the Kano Method axis & MoSCoW Method to help team determine what must be in the minimum viable product, then what should, could, & won’t for now be in the team’s UX design.

Invision
POP
Hype 3
Typeform
Google Drive
Omnigraffle
Keynote
</div>
		<div>Decipher & Empathize
</div>
		<div>User Flow
Draft out a user flow to decide what are the key interactions that need to be designed or iterated on.
Design Studio
Conduct a cross-functional design studio for a well-rounded brainstorm sketch session on the key screens or stages within a user experience. Diverge, converge, diverge, converge.
Wireframe
Using resulting final designs from design studio, create paper wireframes to test first. Once base design is validated through usability tests, continue on by creating low, medium, & high fidelity digital wireframes.
Prototype & Usability Test
Combine wireframes into an iteractive user flow and test with actual users to validate whether or not the design makes sense.
Iterate
Based on usability test results, make changes on the design to better suit user needs & delight.
