		<div>Opportunity: 
Many musicians struggle to profit off their work and many music fans are seeking ways to discover and support musicians. With a redesign of the appLOUD native iOS app and desktop website, we saw an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between artists and music fans by further engaging the appLOUD community.

Goal:Reiterate the appLOUD app, with which we aimed to enable musicians to express their story, brand and performance schedule, while improving the way music fans find, share and tip musicians and their performances.

Challenges:The 3-week timeframe limited the amount of time we had to define our focus.
This affect was seen with - Contextual Inquiry, User interviews with musicians, Stakeholder interviews, Determining MVP.

		<div>At its core, my UX process is based off of the Double Diamond Method & tweaked along the way to suit the needs of each project. Here is a brief overview of how I work.</div>
		<div>DISCOVER

To start, I begin my empathetic journey by understanding the users' needs and the brand goals. Additionally, I analyze the market by comparing the brand with other brands out there.

User Interviews
Stake Holder Interviews
Contextual Inquiry
Competitive & Comparative Analysis</div>

Once I gather enough information, I synthesize all the user research to refine goals & determine the MVP for the project.

After determining the focus for the project time frame, I start the creation stage. This is where I feel I shine the best & have the most fun. It’s important to note, I perform usability testing & Iterate heavily throughout this stage.

		<div>As the backbone of my process, I follow a loose IDEATE UX flow. Why loose? Projects are rarely alike, so my process adapts to the circumstances. A common phrase in User Experience Design is “It depends…”, meaning certain User Experience Design methods can be more or less appropriate in specific instances. I’ve been formally trained with a Lean UX toolkit which keeps me prepares for any project scope. And the learning never stops; I continually look towards “Next Steps”, seeking out new tips & tricks of the trade from mentors to help me iterate my own UX practices. 










Here is a brief overview of how I like to work. Each stage in my process is tweaked along the way to suit the needs of each project.

		<div>ACTUALIZE & TEST & EVOLVE
Once the project scope is refined, I jump into the creation stage. This is my favorite part, where I shine & have the most fun. At this point I’ve finally made sense of the mess & the project focus is now more clear. Typically, I will go through several validated design cycles involving heavy sketching, prototyping, usability testing, & iterations.

+ User flows
+ Sitemaps & appmaps
+ Design studio
+ Sketching
+ Wireframes (paper, lo-fidelity, med-fidelity, hi-fidelity)
+ Prototyping (paper, Axure, Invision)
+ High-fidelity mockups with annotations

</div>
		<div>Investigate
To start, I begin my UX Design journey by defining who users needs and brand goals. Further, I analyze the competitive and comparative markets to learn as much as possible from what has been done (specifically noting what works & what doesn’t).

+ Quantitative surveys
+ User interviews
+ Stakeholder interviews
+ Contextual inquiry
+ Brand analysis
+ Market analysis (competitive + comparative)
</div>
		<div>Decipher & Empathize
Once I gather enough information, I synthesize all of the research by organizing all the information into patterns based on behaviors, context, pain points, & pleasure points of users and the market. Once patterns are identified, I can refine the goals & establish guidelines for the MVP (minimum viable product) of the project

+ Affinity diagraming
+ Feature prioritization
+ MoSCoW method.
+ Personas
+ User stories & journeys
+ Card sorting
