		<div>Experience Design Doers

I’m the co-founder of a different type of Melbourne design thinking community called Experience Design Doers, or XD² for short.

In 2017, we started running workshop events with the goal of providing peer mentorship from design teams in Melb to anyone interested in practising new human-centered design skills in a judgement free environment with friends.

		<div>People nerd at heart

I'm powered by an insatiable curiosity for human behaviors & desire to be helpful. 
I moved from Business into Human-Centred Design (HCD) to have more fun collaborating with customers and team mates.
 
With HCD, I love that I can connect with people, listen to their stories, and help create practical solutions that play a role in making someone’s life less cumbersome and more enjoyable.



What makes me tick?
* Geeking out with passionate teams
* Listening to and sharing stories
* Conversational singing
* Anything with rock climbing 
* Baking bread
* Exploring local markets while traveling


</div>
		<div>UX’ing Breaking into UX 

In an effort to help new designers, I interviewed 34 Experience Design leaders to understand what they look for when expanding their team. 

This SlideShare deck is from my presentation at UX Gatherings Melbourne, where I shared the key golden nuggets gathered from these amazing people.
