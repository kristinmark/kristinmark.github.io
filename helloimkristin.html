		<div>PROJECT OVERVIEW</div>
		<div>PlatformNative iOS mobile
Responsive Web

</div>
		<div>Opportunity: 
Many musicians struggle to profit off their work and many music fans are seeking ways to discover and support musicians. With a redesign of the appLOUD native iOS app and desktop website, we saw an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between artists and music fans by further engaging the appLOUD community.

Goal:Reiterate the appLOUD app, with which we aimed to enable musicians to express their story, brand and performance schedule, while improving the way music fans find, share and tip musicians and their performances.

Challenges:The 3-week timeframe limited the amount of time we had to define our focus.
This affect was seen with - Contextual Inquiry, User interviews with musicians, Stakeholder interviews, Determining MVP.

		<div>Process & Deliverables:
Below are deliverables you go through to read more in-depth about the various UX methods my team & I conducted throughout the project.</div>
		<div>Investigate
To start, I begin my UX Design journey by defining who users needs and brand goals. Further, I analyze the competitive and comparative markets to learn as much as possible from what has been done (specifically noting what works & what doesn’t).

+ Quantitative surveys
+ User interviews
+ Stakeholder interviews
+ Contextual inquiry
+ Brand analysis
+ Market analysis (competitive + comparative)</div>
		<div>ACTUALIZE & TEST & EVOLVE
Once the project scope is refined, I jump into the creation stage. This is my favorite part, where I shine & have the most fun. At this point I’ve finally made sense of the mess & the project focus is now more clear. Typically, I will go through several validated design cycles involving heavy sketching, prototyping, usability testing, & iterations.

+ User flows
+ Sitemaps & appmaps
+ Design studio
+ Sketching
+ Wireframes (paper, lo-fidelity, med-fidelity, hi-fidelity)
+ Prototyping (paper, Axure, Invision)
+ High-fidelity mockups with annotations

		<div>As the backbone of my process, I follow a loose IDEATE UX flow. Why loose? Projects are rarely alike, so my process adapts to the circumstances. A common phrase in User Experience Design is “It depends…”, meaning certain User Experience Design methods can be more or less appropriate in specific instances. I’ve been formally trained with a Lean UX toolkit which keeps me prepares for any project scope. And the learning never stops; I continually look towards “Next Steps”, seeking out new tips & tricks of the trade from mentors to help me iterate my own UX practices. </div>
		<div>Decipher & Empathize
Once I gather enough information, I synthesize all of the research by organizing all the information into patterns based on behaviors, context, pain points, & pleasure points of users and the market. Once patterns are identified, I can refine the goals & establish guidelines for the MVP (minimum viable product) of the project

+ Feature prioritization
+ MoSCoW method.

+ User stories & journeys
+ Card sorting

		<div>I follow a loose IDEATE (investigate > decipher & empathize > actualize & test & evolve) UX flow. Why loose? Projects are rarely alike, so my process adapts to the present objective. A common phrase in User Experience Design is “It depends…”, meaning certain User Experience Design methods can be more or less appropriate in specific circumstances. I’ve been trained by General Assembly NYC in the UX Design Immersive program, which has supplied me with a Lean UX toolkit that prepares me for any project scope. 








Here is a brief overview of how I work. The stages in my process may be tweaked along the way to suit the needs of each project. And the learning never stops; I continually look towards “Next Steps”, seeking out new tips & tricks of the trade from mentors to help me iterate my own UX practices. 
</div>
		<div>ACTUALIZE & TEST & EVOLVE
Once I’ve helped make sense of the mess, the team jumps into the creation stage. This is my favorite part, where I have the most fun because the project focus is now more clear & we can start to getting our hands dirty on the user interface side of things. Typically, there will be several validated design cycles involving heavy sketching, prototyping, usability testing, & iterations. Updates could go on forever, so I timebox my work to allow for a few days before the end of the project to finalize all deliverables.  

+ User flows
+ Sitemaps & appmaps
+ Design studio
+ Sketching
+ Wireframes (paper, lo-fidelity, med-fidelity, hi-fidelity)
+ Prototyping (paper, Axure, Invision)

		<div>WHY UX?
My passion for User Experience Design is fueled by my strong curiosity about human nature & love for creative problem solving. I enjoy partaking in the UXD world because I’m able to make connections with people & hear their stories. Likewise, I take pleasure in ideating practical products & services that double as delightful human experiences.</div>
