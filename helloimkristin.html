		<div>RESUMÉ</div>
		<div>@kristinmark</div>
		<div>My passion for human-centered design is fueled by my insatiable curiosity about human nature & love for feeling helpful. I transitioned from Business into UX because I wanted a job that allowed for more interaction and collaboration. With UX Design, I love that I can connect with people, listen to their stories, and help create research-validated, practical solutions that make lives less cumbersome and more enjoyable.

With a knack for cordial conversation & attention to detail, my strengths lie in client relations, research, prototyping, usability testing, & workshop facilitation. I also enjoy user interface design & interaction design. My previous professional experience includes business analytics, product management, & teaching abroad.

</div>
		<div>Resumé</div>
		<div>I’m a User Experience Design & Research Lead at Bourne Digital. Bourne is a UX on-demand consultancy that specializes in human-centered design solutions for enterprise and startups. While working on client projects, I collaborate with clients on-site to formulate UX strategies, conduct research, redesign user touch points, prototype and usability test solutions, and oversee implementation of product development.

Most recently, I led a 4-week design sprint for Decipha (an Australia Post company) and added support on a 5-week project with Spotlight Group.</div>
