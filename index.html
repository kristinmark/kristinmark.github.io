My specialties are in user research, user experience design, interaction design, and visual design. My previous experience includes business analytics, product management, & teaching abroad.

		<div>Opportunity: 
Many musicians struggle to profit off their work and many music fans are seeking ways to discover and support musicians. With a redesign of the appLOUD native iOS app and desktop website, we saw an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between artists and music fans by further engaging the appLOUD community.

Goal:
Reiterate the appLOUD app, with which we aimed to enable musicians to express their story, brand and performance schedule, while improving the way music fans find, share and tip musicians and their performances.

Challenges:
The 3-week timeframe limited the amount of time we had to define our focus.
This affect was seen with - Contextual Inquiry, User interviews with musicians, Stakeholder interviews, Determining

		<div>At its core, my UX process is based off of the Double Diamond Method & tweaked along the way to suit the needs of each project. Here is a brief overview of how I work.</div>
		<div>DISCOVER

To start, I begin my empathetic journey by understanding the users' needs and the brand goals. Additionally, I analyze the market by comparing the brand with other brands out there.

Quantitative Surveys
User Interviews
Stake Holder Interviews
Contextual Inquiry
Competitive & Comparative Analysis</div>

Once I gather enough information, I synthesize all the user research to refine goals & determine the MVP for the project.

After determining the focus for the project time frame, I start the creation stage. This is where I feel I shine the best & have the most fun.
It’s important to note, I perform usability testing & Iterate heavily throughout this stage.
