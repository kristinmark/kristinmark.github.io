		<div>HELLO, I’M KRISTIN! 
I'm a New York City based UX crazian–crazy Asian–with a bright wardrobe & contagious laugh to boot. My passion for User Experience Design is fueled by an early-age curiosity about people & my love for creative problem solving. I find I enjoy my job because I can easily empathize with humans & design pro-user experiences. My UX specialties include user research & user interface design. My previous professional experience includes business analytics, product management, & teaching abroad. Currently, I am pursuing UX & UI collaboration opportunities with amazing inspiring teams. Willing to travel and/or relocate.
</div>
		<div>MY WORK 
I have experience working on projects with responsive websites & native mobile applications. Most recently I worked on projects were for appLOUD, Time Out New York, and Venmo.
</div>
		<div>SEE CASE STUDIES HERE
</div>
		<div>MY UX PROCESS 
I like to follow through on the entire UX process, loosely following the Double Diamond Method, working from discovery to define to design to delivery. Therefore, I have experience working as a User Researcher, Information Architect, User Interface Designer, Prototyper, Usability Test Facilitator, & Presenter.

		<div>Opportunity: 
Many musicians struggle to profit off their work and many music fans are seeking ways to discover and support musicians. With a redesign of the appLOUD native iOS app and desktop website, we saw an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between artists and music fans by further engaging the appLOUD community.

Goal:
Reiterate the appLOUD app, with which we aimed to enable musicians to express their story, brand and performance schedule, while improving the way music fans find, share and tip musicians and their performances.

Challenges:
The 3-week timeframe limited the amount of time we had to define our focus.

		<div>At its core, my UX process is based off of the Double Diamond Method & tweaked along the way to suit the needs of each project. Here is a brief overview of how I work.</div>
		<div>DISCOVER

To start, I begin my empathetic journey by understanding the users' needs and the brand goals. Additionally, I analyze the market by comparing the brand with other brands out there.

Quantitative Surveys
User Interviews
Stake Holder Interviews
Contextual Inquiry
Competitive & Comparative Analysis</div>
		<div>DEFINE

Once I gather enough information, I synthesize all the user research to refine goals & determine the MVP for the project.

Affinity Mapping
Feature Prioritization
MoSCoW Method
Personas
User Journeys</div>
		<div>LAUNCH</div>
		<div>DESIGN

After determining the focus for the project time frame, I start the creation stage. This is where I feel I shine the best & have the most fun.
It’s important to note, I perform usability testing & Iterate heavily throughout this stage.
