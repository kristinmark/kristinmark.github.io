		<div>Opportunity: 
Many musicians struggle to profit off their work and many music fans are seeking ways to discover and support musicians. With a redesign of the appLOUD native iOS app and desktop website, we saw an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between artists and music fans by further engaging the appLOUD community.

Goal:Reiterate the appLOUD app, with which we aimed to enable musicians to express their story, brand and performance schedule, while improving the way music fans find, share and tip musicians and their performances.

Challenges:The 3-week timeframe limited the amount of time we had to define our focus.
This affect was seen with - Contextual Inquiry, User interviews with musicians, Stakeholder interviews, Determining MVP.

To start, I begin my empathetic journey by understanding the users' needs and the brand goals. Additionally, I analyze the market by comparing the brand with other brands out there.

</div>
		<div>MY APPROACH 

I like to follow through on the entire UX process, loosely following the Double Diamond Method, working from discovery to define to design to delivery. Therefore, I have experience working as a User Researcher, Information Architect, User Interface Designer, Prototyper, Usability Test Facilitator, & Presenter. 
</div>
		<div>I’m a New York City UX crazian with a bright wardrobe & contagious laugh to boot.

My passion for User Experience Design is fueled by my strong curiosity about human nature & love for creative problem solving. What I love most about my UX role is connecting with people & hearing their stories. As a result, I am passionate about creating practical interfaces that double as delightful human experiences. 

My UX specialties are user research, user interaction design, user interface design, & usability testing. My previous professional experience includes business analytics, product management, & teaching abroad.

Currently, I’m pursuing UX & UI collaboration opportunities with inspiring, forward thinking teams. Willing to travel and/or relocate.
